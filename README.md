# Project Description
This project is an example of using Firebase Kotlin SDK and Compose in an Android application. Firebase Kotlin SDK provides a set of tools for interacting with Firebase, while Compose is a declarative way of creating user interfaces in Android apps.

# Technologies Used
Firebase Kotlin SDK: a library for interacting with Firebase in Kotlin-based Android apps.
Compose: a framework for creating user interfaces in Android apps.
App Functionality
This app implements a simple functionality - the user can authenticate with Firebase Authentication and then view a list of notes previously created by them. The user can also create, edit, and delete notes.

# Project Structure
The project consists of several packages:

data: contains classes for working with Firebase, including data model classes and classes for accessing Firebase Firestore and Firebase Authentication.
ui: contains user interface classes written using Compose.
utils: contains helper classes and utilities.

# How to Use the Project
To use the project, you need to clone the repository using the command:

git clone https://github.com/gorban-dev/google-auth-kmm-example.git

Then, you need to add the google-services.json file containing Firebase configuration to the app/ folder. After that, you can build and run the app on an Android device or emulator.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates a simple example of using Firebase Kotlin SDK and Compose in an Android app. We hope it will be helpful for learning these technologies.
